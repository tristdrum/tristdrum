**Calm African technologist · CTO & co-founder at [WorkWeek](https://workweek.africa) · Builder of human-first systems.**

This repository powers [tristdrum.com](https://tristdrum.com) — a black, cinematic single-page experience that keeps animations intentional, typography confident, and copy grounded in the truth of my work.

## Highlights & principles

1. **Care stack first** – Map the operating rhythm before writing code or hiring.
2. **Motion with intent** – Animation guides attention; if it distracts, it goes.
3. **Infrastructure with heart** – Tools must work offline/data-free and still feel human.
4. **Humble excellence** – Celebrate collaborators, measure accuracy, and let outcomes speak.

## Active builds

- **WorkWeek** – Co-founder/CTO (20% shareholder). Six-person fully-remote crew replacing paper timesheets and clunky biometric machines with selfie + geofenced clock-ins, automated overtime, and payroll for blue-collar teams. Breakeven on ~ZAR250k MRR and still growing after spinning out of The Delta’s Codelight team.
- **Tech Local** – 50/50-owned vibe-coder studio that trains non-technical talent, automates agency rails, and ships WhatsApp onboarding flows, Supabase back offices, OpenAI platform agents, and AI-orchestrated deployments for South African businesses.
- **Champ Foundation** – Voucher-backed dignity platform (formerly Heartflow) piloted in Stellenbosch; re-aligns donor incentives and NPO accountability so individual beneficiaries can be tracked from relief to reintegration.

## Personal site scripts

```
cd web
npm install
npm run dev          # start the local development server
npm run build        # produce the static bundle in dist/
```

- Built with React + TypeScript + Vite.
- Single-page layout composed in `src/App.tsx`.
- Global theming and motion defined in `src/App.css` and `src/index.css`.
- Google Fonts (Space Grotesk, Manrope) preloaded for sharp typography.

> Vite 5 prefers Node `>=18`. Node `20.18` runs cleanly with this setup.
